                Every country has its faults, we just need to be honest about them and Cambodia is no different. We are here to support
                you in creating a positive and joyful experience. if you decide to explore the World of teaching and visit an exotic
                land like Cambodia, we want you to be prepared for everything. So, we wonâ€™t lie to you about the fact that it is still
                very much a developing country and a lot of the luxury amenities are unlikely to be available to you. Kitchen appliances
                and other, general house hold electricals can be rare to find but not impossible and it will come with a price tag.
                However, if you wish to live like a true local and spend minimal on your monthly rent, you could be spending as little
                as forty quid. An apartment at this price, will still come with an easily accessible cold shower, sink and toilet. One
                substantial size room, with a kitchen side board and sink.
